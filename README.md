# HouseWorth

This repository contains a Python implementation for predicting house prices using machine learning techniques. The code utilizes a dataset of housing features to train and evaluate two regression models: Linear Regression and Random Forest Regression. The best model is selected based on a combined evaluation of Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared (R²).

4. To access the webpage interface, open `http://127.0.0.1:5000` in your web browser.

## Model Evaluation

The code evaluates the performance of the models using Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared (R²) metrics. The results for both models are shown below.

### Results

- **Linear Regression**
  - Mean Squared Error: 85.57
  - R-squared: 0.71

- **Random Forest Regression**
  - Mean Squared Error: 102.19
  - R-squared: 0.65

## Model Selection

The best model is selected based on a combined score derived from both MSE and R². The MSE is inverted for normalization (since lower values are better), while R² is used as-is (since higher values are better). The combined score is calculated as follows:

```python
combined_score = 0.5 * normalized_mse + 0.5 * normalized_r2
```

The model with the highest combined score is considered the best model and is saved for future use.

the best model was determined to be **Linear Regression** with the following metrics:

- **Best Model MSE**: 85.57
- **Best Model R²**: 0.71
